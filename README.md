This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX. In these projects, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
